    <p>MY NAME IS GODWIN, popularly known as rukky 
        I'm blessed when I see my family and friends happy, I would rather give than to receive. I possess a great sense of humor, I love Life, animals and I'm passionate about so many things, but I'd like to leave a few things for you to discover yourself, the journey of discovering is half the fun... I'm an affectionate Open-minded, loving, caring, respectful I never give up on Web Development. I'm not about what a person owns, as much as I cherish what they hold dear to their heart. My future ambitions are living like there is no tomorrow, and I so desire a digital skill, GOD BLESS ME AND MY FAMILY, MR ZACK, MR ISRAEL, THE INCUBATOR AND MY PASTOR DADDY 3E'S.
